# SCLM415 – Data Analysis Assignment For Forecasting Product Units

## 📌 Project Overview
This Excel file is used for analysis in the **SCLM415 (Supply Chain & Logistics Management)** course.  
The dataset is organized into a single worksheet where raw data, calculations, and analytical logic are combined to support supply chain–related decision making.

The focus of this assignment is to apply **Excel functions**, particularly conditional aggregation, to process data, perform calculations, and generate insights relevant to supply chain management.

## 📊 Excel File Structure

### Sheet: `Data`
**Purpose:**  
This worksheet serves as the central workspace for the assignment. It contains:
- Raw input data
- Intermediate calculations
- Final outputs used to support analysis and conclusions

Rather than separating tasks across multiple sheets, all logic is implemented within this single sheet to maintain clarity and traceability.

## 🔧 Excel Functions & Their Purposes

The following Excel functions are used in the `Data` sheet to support different analytical objectives:

### 1. `SUMIFS()`
**Purpose:**  
- Aggregate numerical values **based on one or multiple conditions**.

**Usage context:**  
Used to calculate totals such as quantities, costs, or volumes by applying specific criteria (e.g., item type, supplier, time period, or status), which is common in supply chain analysis.

---

### 2. `AVERAGE()`
**Purpose:**  
- Calculate mean values across a defined data range.

**Usage context:**  
Applied to determine average demand, cost, or performance indicators.

---

### 3. `IFERROR()`
**Purpose:**  
- Handle potential errors in formulas gracefully.

**Usage context:**  
Prevents calculation errors (such as division by zero or missing data) from disrupting the analysis.

---

### 4. Basic arithmetic formulas
**Purpose:**  
- Perform direct calculations such as multiplication, division, and subtraction.

**Usage context:**  
Used to derive performance metrics, ratios, or adjusted values required for supply chain evaluation.
